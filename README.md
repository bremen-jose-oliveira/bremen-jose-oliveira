## 🚀 About Me  
I bring a unique perspective to software development, shaped by a diverse professional background. My journey started in Portugal, where I wore many hats: bartender, assistant in a computer store, and even a meat cutter at a supermarket.  

📦 **In Germany,** I built expertise in logistics and warehouse management. But I always knew where my true passion lay: technology.  

🎓 **Full Stack Bootcamp Graduate:** I took the leap and transitioned into tech, and now I’m proud to work as a **Full Stack Developer**, crafting solutions and building scalable, efficient applications.
